    "auditSectionText": "Our comprehensive risk audit methodology employs NIST SP 800-30 and ISO 27005 standards to systematically evaluate operational, technological, and environmental threats across your organizational ecosystem. Utilizing threat intelligence feeds and proprietary risk-scoring algorithms, we identify critical vulnerabilities in your infrastructure, processes, and supply chain, enabling data-driven prioritization of remediation efforts before disruptions escalate into business-impacting incidents.",

        "text": "Our facility resilience assessment evaluates protection against natural disasters (earthquakes, floods), utility failures (power grid instability, HVAC system vulnerabilities), and physical security breaches (unauthorized access, equipment theft). We implement tiered safeguards including: UL-listed fire suppression systems, Tier III+ data center specifications, biometric access controls, and environmental monitoring with automated failover protocols to maintain uptime during disruptive events."
